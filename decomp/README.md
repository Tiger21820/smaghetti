# SMA4 decomp

This directory is for the decompilation of SMA4. For now it will live in the Smaghetti repo, but as things progress it might make sense to move it to its own repo.

## Goal

Decompile all of SMA4 from ARM assembly back to C with the intent of truly learning how the game works. The learnings will be applied to Smaghetti to make it a fully capable SMA4 editor.

## Code of conduct

Please see the [code of conduct](https://github.com/city41/smaghetti/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), as it applies to the decomp effort as well. Most notably, do not share, link to or ask for any copyrighted information. This includes game ROMs, official e-reader levels, disassemblies, etc.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This effort has just started and I've never done anything like this before. So at first it will likely be rocky and all over the place. If you have experience with tools like Ghidra and Radare2, or just reverse engineering in general, I'd love your input.

See the [decomp project](https://github.com/city41/smaghetti/projects/3) for current status.

## Target ROM

The "1.1" version of the US rom of SMA4 for GBA is the main decompilation target.
