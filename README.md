# Archived as of Feb 16, 2023q

Smaghetti is no longer worked on by me (Matt Greer). I would love to, but I just don't have the time anymore.
The remaining things that Smaghetti needs are really big and hard, and the tiny pockets of free time here and
there I have just don't work for that, as much as I have tried.

If you want to pick up Smaghetti, feel free to fork this repo. I will be available with any questions about its codebase.

The Smaghetti website will remain up for one more year, and taken down on February 24, 2024.

## Try it

It's available here: https://smaghetti.mattgreer.dev

## Editor quick start

The editor is at https://smaghetti.mattgreer.dev/editor

It is very user friendly and takes loose inspiration from Nintendo's Mario Maker.

Proper documentation and tutorial videos will come later, but for now just start playing with it, most people have been able to figure it out. If you get stuck, start a discussion here in the repo. I always welcome feedback to make things better.
