## Try it

It's available here: https://smaghetti.com

## Status

At the time of writing, Smaghetti has extracted out 262 entities from the game for use in creating levels. A lot of progress has been made, but a lot more work still lies ahead. For a high level view, check the [roadmap](https://smaghetti.com/roadmap)

## Editor quick start

The editor is at https://smaghetti.com/editor

It is very user friendly and takes loose inspiration from Nintendo's Mario Maker. 

Proper documentation and tutorial videos will come later, but for now just start playing with it, most people have been able to figure it out. If you get stuck, start a discussion here in the repo. I always welcome feedback to make things better.

## Reverse engineering

The [discussions](https://github.com/city41/smaghetti.com/discussions) are now where most reverse engineering talk is taking place. There is also the [wiki](https://github.com/city41/smaghetti/wiki) and [issues](https://github.com/city41/smaghetti/issues).

### HexTree tool

This tool is growing to be pretty powerful. It really lets you explore and manipulate a level. I need to document a bit how it works, but just playing with it should enable one to figure out most of its features.

It is here: https://smaghetti.com/tools/hex-tree

There are some other minor tools listed here too: https://smaghetti.com/tools

## Code contributions

PRs are welcome, but please open an issue and discuss with me first before starting any work. That way no one does any wasted effort. The code is pretty messy and in many parts of the codebase I'm more focused on figuring stuff out than creating clean code. So I am refactoring pretty often. I'd hate to merge a refactor that really harms someone else's PR.

## Bug reports

Since Smaghetti is so young, there are a ton of bugs. Feel free to file them here as an issue
