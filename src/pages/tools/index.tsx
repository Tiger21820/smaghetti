					<h2 className="block text-lg">These tools are very raw and buggy</h2>
					They are just good enough to get the job done. I put them here in case
					people are curious and want to try them. If you want to help reverse
					engineer the game with these tools and are having trouble,{' '}
					<a href="mailto:matt.e.greer@gmail.com">let me know</a> and I can make
					them easier to use

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<a href="./hex-tree">Hex Tree</a>: A pretty powerful tool that
							lets you explore a level, edit it, and see your changes right away
							in an emulator. Becoming the best way to reverse engineer the
							game.
						</p>
						<p>
							Still a work in progress, but the goal is to be a powerful tool
							that really allows reverse engineering to be effective, stay
							tuned.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="./palettes">Palettes</a>: renders the currently extracted
						sprites in a bunch of palettes pulled from the game. This is to help
						find the correct palette to assign to a sprite or object in the
						editor.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="./tiles">Tiles</a>: extracts all of the compressed and
						uncompressed tiles from the ROM and displays them on the screen. It
						also includes a byte search to enable locating a tile using data
						pulled from an emulator (I am using mGBA).
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="./rom-layout">ROM Layout</a>: a table of byte sections in
						the ROM which can be code, data, graphics, audio, etc. Brand new and
						has a loooooong ways to go.
					</li>
