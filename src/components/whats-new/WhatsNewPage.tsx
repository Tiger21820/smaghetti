					<p className="bg-green-500 text-white p-1.5 -mx-1.5">
						Ultimately Smaghetti will let you configure the camera so that it

					<div className="bg-red-200 text-red-900 font-bold p-2">
						If your level uses wood or underwater floor, please read
					</div>
					<p>
						Underwater floor and wood floor were not implemented well. It was
						possible to use them in such a way your level would get corrupted.
						So I redid how they work. They now behave more like pipes and
						conveyor belts in that you have to size them with a drag handle.
					</p>
					<p>
						If your level had underwater or wood floor in it, they will be
						removed the next time you load the level. You will need to re-add
						them using the new approach. Sorry about that, but breaking changes
						like this are inevitable during early preview.
					</p>
					<div className="bg-green-200 text-green-900 p-2">
						But some good news, this new approach paves the way for the big

				<NewEntry title="Stretch Boo split into two entities" date="2021-06-10">
					<p>
						Originally Stretch Boo was one entity and Smaghetti would choose to

						mean you couldn&apos;t position a Stretch Boo how you wanted it in
						some situations.
					</p>
					<p>
						So now Stretch Boo comes in upright and upside down variants and you
